Nowadays, there are many different categories of music in the world. some people argue that why we like listening music everyday, and others think traditional music should be more important than international music.

music can enrich people's spiritual life and mental well-being,so we need music every day. 
This is because music makes people feel comfortable and relaxed, which helps to release stress. as a result, it is benefit for people's mental health.
