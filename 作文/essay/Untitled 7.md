# line chart



The line chart compares how much electricity was produced using four different sources in France from 1980 to 2012.

It is clear that Nuclear power was the main source of electricity production in France during 30-year period. By contrast ,  The Renewables power energy produced the lowest  amount of electricity over the period shown.

In 1980, Nuclear stations provided 50 terawatt  hours of electricity which was less than the Thermal  power. However, only one year later, It took over Thermal power became the primary source of electricity production, additionally, the amount of thermal electricity saw a small decrease around 50 terawatt hours until to 1980. The Hydroelectric electricity produced  a similar level with Nuclear in 1980, and Renewables power only  provided a very small contribution.

After 1990, the amount of Nuclear electricity  saw a very significant increase and reached the peak of around 440 terawatt hours in 2005.  the figures of Hydroelectric and Thermal  both remained at a relatively stable level by 50 terawatt hours each year. Although, the number of electricity from Renewables  increased from 2000, but it is still remained the lowest  among  this four kinds of electricity sources.
