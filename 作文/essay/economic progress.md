# Economic Progress

Many governments think that economic progress is their most important goal.
Some people, however, think that other types of progress are equally
important for a country. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

1. 证明经济发展不是最重要的目标
2. 文化发展同样对国家重要。

Some people think that other types of progress are equally important as economic progress for a country. However, many governments believe that economic progress should be the primary goal. In my opinion, although economic development is very important for a country, I believe that cultural progress and social rights progress are just as important as economic progress.

On the one hand, cultural development is also important for a country. To be more specific, cultural development makes people feel confident about their own country's culture. Therefore, more and more people are willing to share their voices and opinions in the international world. As a result, some people will be attracted by this culture, and some of them will even visit this country. The local government can charge ticket fees from these visitors, which will increase the local economy. For instance, Japan provides a very successful example. There are many successful cultural productions and famous movie stars. Every year, about 30 million tourists visit Japan, which generates a huge income for the Japanese government and local citizens.

On the other hand, some people argue that governments should spend all their money on economic progress. This is because economic progress can enable the local government to invest more money in building cities, which will increase people's living quality. However, opponents of this idea believe that if governments do not protect people's rights and maintain social balance, economic growth and urban development will only benefit the wealthy. Most people do not have the time and money to enjoy the benefits of city development.

In conclusion, although economic progress is very important to city development, cultural and people's rights should also be considered.
