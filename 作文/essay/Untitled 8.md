# climate change 



Some people argue that we need to find a way to live with earth climate change rather than preventing it change. In my view, I strongly disagree with this opinion, because i think other animals will not survive in climate change and i do not believe humans can find out a way to live with it. 

On the one hand, remaining climate stable bring a clear benefit to native creatures. Preventing climate change enables other wild animals have space to live. This is because many kinds of forest will disappear due to these trees can not suffer climate change. therefore animals will be lost living area and  it will be dead because of lack of food or captured by other animals. For instance, In China, There is a kind of  bird named DanDingHe that only live on a special forest called HongFeng in the north east of China. the numbers of DanDingHe are very small. Additionally, the HongFeng forest almost disappeared in 21th century. So, When Scientist found this bird that only  one survived. 

On the other hand, Although, humans want to find a way to live with it that is also very difficult, which is a huge complex project for human. Living in a harsh climate like more dry or hot is a big challenge to science and technology and we do not sure we have enough time to solve these question before earth do not welcome humans. For example, in 20th century, American scientists were building a close environment, which was a test project for moon base. However, somehow, this environment was lack of oxygen and animals dead. So, they had to stop this  project. Therefore, human still can not live without earth today.
