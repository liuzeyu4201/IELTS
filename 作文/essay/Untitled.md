# permissive parenting
Some parents buy their children whatever they ask for, and allow their children
to do whatever they want. Is this a good way to raise children? 

What consequences could this style of parenting have for children as they get older?

it is true that some parents give their children anything that they have , And they even do not teach their kid when he did a mistake.

i am completely disagree this educational method.

the mainly reason is that children were may built a completely wrong cognition to our society cause their parents do not teach them when they were kids.  use a common example to this practice that parents buy  anything  if their kid ask for that might lend to these kids do not  care with their money, and if parent do not tell their kids what they can do and what they can not  do  that might lend to their kid do not respect others  because they never try to do this, even they may break the law when they grow up.



other issue is that  most of these kid  that their parent always allow them are unsuccess in their career life. these kids often can not good cooperate with   colleagues. they are lack of meaningful communication with others because they can not have a good talk  with others. people are unwilling to talk and share ideas with selfish guys. these children do not know thinking for others , they are always asking for himself that lead to  them can not have a comfortable work environment. However some supporters with this style of parenting argue that allow children to do anything they want can protect their confidence. 

To summarize , although views on this issue vary from person to person, i tend to believe that  this parenting style lend to children are always unsuccess with their work because they can not think for others and lack of meaning communication with others
