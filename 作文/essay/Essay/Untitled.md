ã€€An increasing number of people are **changing careers** during their working life. What do you think are the **reasons for this**? Do you think this is a **positive** or negative development for **society**?







It is obvious that more and more people are willing to change their job during their working life. In my opinion, This is because many types of jobs are being replaced by the advanced technologies. And I think that the growing number of people change their jobs, which is a symbol of social progress.



It is clear that the advanced technology has made many types of jobs that do not be needed  for society. Computer sciences and industrial technology have a huge improvement in recently years, more and more new methods which is cheaper and more efficient than production by traditional hand-making have  created by scientist and applied to production.  When their jobs were replaced by these new technologies, those have to look for a new employment.  For example, the robotic arms than can work 24/7 have being used for  many factories, causing many workers to lose their jobs. Moreover, the robot taxi driving by AI can run a business all days and companies do not need to pay salaries to drivers, so the human drivers are losing their jobs.



In my view, one benefit for this situation is that changing careers can improve  work efficiency . Many people decide to work in a new field, because they may disliked their previous jobs.  As we know, if someone works in a field where he is enjoyed, he is more motivated.  Because of this, it is necessary for people to try different types of jobs  to find their interests. 

In conclusion, I believe that the advanced technology leads to this social situation and makes possible to promote social efficiency.
