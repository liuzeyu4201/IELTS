Instead of asking the government to bear the cost of higher education, students should **pay their own tuition fees themselves** . Do you agree or disagree with this **statement**?



It is clear that students should pay their own college course fees by themselves rather than asking for money from the government. I strongly agree with this statement, while it may have a negative effect on students' learning attention. In this essay, I would like to outline governmental and  individual benefits and a problem.

The governmental benefit is that the governments will have more disposable money, if students do not receive money from the governments to pay their tuition fees. It is clear that providing financial support to students poses an economic challenge for local government. If this situation is changed, the governments are able to use this  sum of money which is used to pay tuition fees to invest in increasing citizens' living standards or narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor,such as cutting tax for the low-income families.

The individual benefit is that paying tuition fees by themselves would make them study harder. Some students do not feel anxiety and pressure when they do not pass the exams because they do not pay anything for education. By contrast, If students are required  to support their eduction, they are likely to feel a sense of responsibility so they will have a better attitude to study and  they would be full of motivation.

Meanwhile,if some families cannot afford the college tuition fees for their children, students may need to take part-time jobs to cover the cost of education, which  may  distract their attention on study. Students may do part-time jobs like community volunteers after school or on the weekend to earn their living fees so that they probably do not have time to study or build relationships with others, which is has a negative effect on their test scores and mental health. For example,some students would become volunteers to clean the rubbish in the streets on the weekend. Therefore,working probably will occupy their all the weekend,and that time can be used in studying to widen their knowledge.

In conclusion, there are benefits to discharging governments' economic burden and encouraging students to study hard, but it also leads to distracting students' attention.
