这是一篇雅思作文，你帮我评分。 题目是： In many countries, the proportion of older people is steadily increasing, Does this trend have Pos or NEG effects on society? 我的回答是：

It is true that the percentage of older people is consistently growing in many countries. In my opinion, I strongly believe that this trend may bring many social problems.

the first problem is that most of the older people are willing to save money rather than spending, so that it may impede economic development. This is because the older people are  increasingly feeling a sense of fear about their healthy. saving money can provide a sense of safety for them. However, the companies  can not make more profits because there are not customers who buy their products.  some factories probably go bankrupt. For example, In China, the supermarkets have disappeared in many small towns where the proportion of older people has reached nearly 70%.

the other problem is that the health care costs will increase, which impose a  heavy burden on taxpayers. Most health needs and costs are more likely to increase in later years. with age,  people are not able to support their lives and medical costs. Therefore, it is necessary for governments to  pour more money on taking care of elderly and building hospitals.  This may have a negative impact on investments in  schools and facilities. For instance, more and more younger families must save a sum of money, when their parents have chronic disease like high blood pressure or heart disease, which often requires a lot money.

In conclusion, the aging population has presented a challenge to health care in many countries. This can have  a negative effect on social economic.
