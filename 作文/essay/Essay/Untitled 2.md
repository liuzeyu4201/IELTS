In most universities there are more **male** students than **female** students on **science courses**. What is the **reason** for this? 

What could be done to **balance out the numbers**ï¼Ÿ



It is clear that there is a huge gap between the number of male students and female students on natural scienice subjects. In my opinion, the primary reason is likely to lead to this situation, which is the traditional educational concept. And I think that setting extra female job oppotunities in science companies can change this situation.

The main reason for this gap  is that most teachers consider that male students can do better than female students in science courses. To be honest, this idea has been believed  strongly in most parents and teachers for a long period. For example, we know about a lot of male scientists such as Newton in our textbook, but there are  only a few female scientist. Therefore, these teachers would pay attention to male students but fucus less on girls, which  leads to girls get a lower grades on exams. Because of this, Most female students lost confience in science, so they choose to other majors in universities.

For this reason, we can suggest companies should provide more job opportunities for wemen. For instance, If some science insititutions hire more females researchers, these female researchers would  be able to  find a good job with well-paid in technological companies. They can be examples to encourage female students to study in science courses. 

In conclusion, I strongly believe that traditional education systems leads to this gap between the number of male and female  students on science courses in higher education. But providing well-paid jobs in science field for female employees can help takcle this problem.
