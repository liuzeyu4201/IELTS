Some people believe that children can learn effectively by watching TV and should be encourage to watch TV both  at home and at school. To what extent    do you agree or disagree?



There are some parents who believe that  watching TV cam enhance children's learning efficiency. I agree this idea although it may can get response from teachers.

Firstly, Watching TV series can help students to keep concentration on studying so children are more willing to learn knowledge. This is because Children are more easy to be attracted by videos and sounds. Children often get interests from watching online course on TV and they are willing to spend more time on learning. For example, teachers often let students watching English movies in English listening courses because children are attracted by interesting stories, So that they show more motivation on learning English which is goods for learning efficiency.

Another benefit is that children are able to choose the course to learn that they interest. It is obviously that online course can provide more advanced and wider knowledge than traditional courses so that students can get special skills that are not taught in class.  If the knowledge is they want, they will do more efforts and spend more time on studying.

On the other hand, students can not received any response form teachers. Students are often get problems on new learned knowledges. Teachers sometimes need to change teaching speed if most of students feel that are not easy to understand the lecture content. But the TV courses have  recorded on videos which is leads to lack response by teachers.

In conclusion, watching TV provides a opportunities for students to enhance learning efficiency but lacking communication with teacher would become a problem.
