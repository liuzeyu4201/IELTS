The efficient functioning of society is based on rules and laws. Society would not function well if individuals were free to do whatever they wanted. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Some people argue that weather a society can function well with no rules. In my opinion, a society without laws can not maintain order.

If not laws and rules regulated people's behaviour, the society would be in chaos and the economy would collapse.

The biggest aim for laws is talking people what they can do and if people break the law, the efficiency of society will reduced.

if some people obey the traffic rules, the traffic accidents will  increase and the traffic congestion would become a problem. Therefore, the employees are able to get work on time which is leads to reduce production efficiency.



If not laws punish crimes, it can damage cause to social stability.

most of people do not commit crimes as they fear the result. But if  the police have no rights to capture crimes, the criminal rates will rapidly increase.

some people will rob the innocent people for money,and someone will not go outside because they fear their safety.

with more companies go bankrupt, the more and more people would  commit crimes for living.





Another reason is that the employees who can do anything that they want in work time can lead to huge negative effects on the productivity of companies. There are no workers who have motivation to work because they can not be rewarded by working hard and they know that they will be not fired,even though they do not achieve production targets. The delivery companies of profitability are going to reduce because the traffic must be  congesting if there is no drivers to obey the traffic rules.

On the other hand, Some opponents argue that rules usually limit the personal thought. Some talents have to learn knowledge in class which they are already to know.  But they forget that communicating efficiently  is need to learn in a group and is also a important skill in their future career life.

In conclusion, I believe that  society do not have legislations and rules, which is leads to a damage impact on development of companies and societies.

while the tough laws probably impede social progress.
