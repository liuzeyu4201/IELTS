Some people believe famous people's support towards international aid organizations draws the attention to problems, while others think celebrities make the problems less important. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

Some people claim that  famous people can help international aid organizations collect the attention to problems, meanwhile others believe that they can only make things worse. I will discuss both viewpoints and explain why i support famous people can contribute to overcome challenges.

On the one hand, those who support celebrities argue that The opinion of celebrities can share to audiences very quickly. This is because they are often attend TV shows and  interviews, So everyone will receive their appeals as long as they have watched TV and it will be quickly shared to everywhere in this country.  For example,  about 10 years ago, there was a serious earthquake in China. According to a survey by local government, 30 thousand people were dead in this accident. many actors published posts on social media to collect money. And just 2 days, they received amount 20 million dollars. 

On the other hand, proponents of actors will  make the problems more worse claim that the voice of actors  is often not trusted by people. This factor is crucial because actors are often make up many fake news to  earn attentions such as getting married  or making relationships with someone. Therefore, many people have been dismissed the opinions from actors. However, it is clear that this kind of things are not  happened on  all of actors. 

In conclusion, both side have valid points. while former group of people focuses on celebrities have more attentions, and other people emphasizes people often do not trust actors. In my opinion, I believe famous people can make a effort , helping aid organizations.
