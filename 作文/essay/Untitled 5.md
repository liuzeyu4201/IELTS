# homework 

Recently,some parents argue that whether teachers should give assignments to school children. In my opinion, i agree with that young students need to do homework when they after school, but i  think these homework  should be encouraged students  who using their hands to finish these tasks rather than always writing  in the desk.

On the one hand ,it is clear that too many homework that might be damage the interest of children in exploring the nature world. 

So, opponents of doing homework believe that  children should spent their free time on their real exciting things like playing instruments or sports .

Parents are think these activates can make their children showed differents.

If teachers given too many homework will lead to children spent most of time and energy ,so that they have less interest on personal activites,beacause they have been feel tired to finish homework.



On the other hand,supporters of giving homework believe that homework are also an essential part of school education.

 This is because homework ususlly used to check understanding of knowledge. 

For instance , if children was distraced in class which may lead to they can not  solve the question of homework. 

Meanwhile ,if the students  recivied a great score with homework which means they have understanded this class mian ideas. 

In my opinion , I believe that teachers can be assign more open homework and less repeat and regular homework. Specifically, Open homework means  there are no right answers that make every given their special responses ,which not only incentive the insterest of explore but also help children  learn knowledge.

On the one hand,supporters of giving homework believe that homework are also an essential part of school education. The homework usually were an exercise of class knowledge, beacause The class time were limited, which can not ensure everyone easily using these knowledge . So the homework is a good chance for students  doing exercise, for instance, math teachers often were giving students with calculating exercises , allowing them finish it in home . Obvirously ,this is a good way that not only ensure enough exercise but also do not take in the class time. 

In addtional, teachers  were using such homework to measure students whether  have understanded  knowledge. teachers often change their perparation with next class depend on  the score of last homework that always as a sign of how student received of class knowledge.

 On the other hand, Opponents of such idea believe that too many homeworks may lead to children indulge in Video game,as children were spending most of time and energy to do their home ,beacuse He have been too exhausted when they have finished homework,so they were more likely to choice the video games  that they do not need thinking .

In contrast, the supporters think that not every children have self-controling on playing instruments or positive activities,if children do not need to do homework, So they will have more free time after school,they might would  rather spending more times on video games.

Recently, some parents have debated whether teachers should assign homework to school children.

**In my opinion, I believe that young students should be assigned homework after school.**

On the one hand, supporters of homework argue that it plays an essential role in the education of students. Homework is often an exercise to reinforce class knowledge, as class time is limited and cannot ensure that every student fully understands the material. Therefore, homework provides an opportunity for students to practice and consolidate what they have learned. For instance, math teachers often assign calculation exercises for students to complete at home. Obviously, this method not only ensures sufficient practice but also prevents valuable class time from being taken up.

Additionally, teachers use homework as a tool to assess whether students have understood the material. Teachers often adjust their lesson plans based on the results of homework assignments，This feedback loop helps ensure that no student falls behind in their studies.

On the other hand, opponents argue that too much homework may lead to students spending excessive time on assignments, thereby neglecting other activities, such as playing video games. After hours of homework, students may feel exhausted and are more likely to turn to video games, which require less mental effort and provide instant gratification.

However, supporters counter that not all children possess the self-discipline to engage in productive activities when they are free from homework. Without assignments, students might spend their extra time on video games or other distractions, which would not contribute to their personal growth or academic progress.
