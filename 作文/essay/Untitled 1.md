The line graph compares the amount of  electricity produced using four  different sources of power over 32 years.

it is clear that Nuclear power was by far the most important means of electricity generation.

In addition, the amount of electricity that provided by renewables power saw a significantly rose **starting** from 1995.

(it is clear that Nuclear power experienced a significant increase and became the dominant source of electricity, while other sources either remained  relatively stable or showed slower growth, except for renewables ,which saw a small rise starting from 1995   )

In 1980,  about 120 terawatt hours electricity that produced by Thermal power **made it** the main source of electricity generation.  

Meanwhile(**additionally**), Nuclear power and Hydroelectric provide(**generated**)  similiar  amount of electrity **at** approximately 50 terawatt hours **each**.  

However, ( ) Renewables as the most unpopular way of electricity gerneration( **as the least used source ,**) provide negligible amount of electricity.



Between 1980 and 2010, Nuclear power quickly take over thermal as the primary way of electricity production and saw a spiral reach to about(**peaking at around**) 430 terawatt hours in 2005 .

in contrast,( )  Renewables power were more and more( **remained less**) unpopular in Franch , So the amount of electricity that provided by Renewables  fall in(**by**) 30 terawatt hours every year,and remain at this level  in following years.

Using Hydroelectric produce about 52 terawatt hours electricity every year in Franch and remain a relative(**relatively**) stable at this level  over the period of shown.

finally,() Renewables have attentioned(notice) from 1995 ,which provide  by far about 35 terawatt hours electricity every year.
