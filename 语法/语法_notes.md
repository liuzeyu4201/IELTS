## 句子结构

**📘及物与非及物动词**

```
💡 
john died in world-war2 

john killed two enermies.

如果句子为john killed 无实义。
```

🎯 及物动词需要跟一个宾语接受动作。



**📘宾语：接受动作的载体。**

**📘补语： 动词可以翻译为“是/be”（多为系动词）的情况下，需要有补语存在才能表达意思。**

系动词包括（look,seem,appear,sound,feel,taste,prove,become,make）

```
💡  the soup is hot
is 翻译为是的概念。 “汤是热的”。
```

**📘宾补是指补语补充宾词的"是"什么**。

```
💡 we find this dress pretty
主+动词+宾语+宾补
dress is pretty.
I consider the story false.
```

**📘双宾：两个宾语之间平等。**

```
💡 john'father gave him a dog(双宾)
john'father call him a dog(宾+宾补)
他爸骂他是狗。
他爸给他一只狗。
```

**📘名词短语与冠词**

**📘 a/an 是one的替换。 如果名词不适合使用一个来交代则不加，专有名词可以不加。**

📘The 是that的替换，有明确的指代功能（那一个）

🎯 有时有多个专有名词类需要加the the dead sea、the pacific ocean(the pacific)





## 时态

**📘 一般时是指一段时间表示。大小不限，<span style="color:red">  但必须有明确的时间表示</span> .**

**🎯  Ved(被动)、Ving（进行、正在）**

**📘 过去：** 

```
💡 
The Us established relationship with china in 1979.
The us was established by a group of dreamer in 1485.
a group of dream established us in 1485.
I was doing homework last night.
He was being hitted by his parents.

```

🎯 最后一个例子was 表示过去，being 正在，hit 被动。

**📘现在 可以忽略时间指示，因为现在。**

```
💡 
All mothers love his child.
he is married 
```

🎯 be+Ved 表示过去分词，表示被动完成。与时态无关。

**📘未来：需要时间指示。**

```
💡 
There will be a major election in the next mouth.
The building will be building in march.
```

**📘 完成时： 以箭头表达时间，并不对时间明确交代**

```
I have seen this face.
I have been working one month.
I have been hitted last night
I have been smoking three packs of cigrate a day.
```



## 分词

**📘分词应该理解为形容词词性。**

**📘 现在分词~形容词（暗示持续性）**

```
The black dog doesn't bit.
The barking dog doesn't bit.
```

📘过去分词表示（被动、完成）be+ved 被动态。

```
Boiled water is safe to drink.
I cannot find my wallet, it is gone. 
I am done.
he is disappointed by his scores.
His scores are disappointing.

water is composed of drogen and oxygen.
This case is being investgated by police.

```



## 非谓语

📘 不定式和动名词都属于非谓语，可以扩充句子中的动词数量。但本质是从句的简化。

**📘不定式短语： to+do 可以视为助动词的变化。**

**🎯 不定式与助动词1. 都接动词原形。2.都有不确定性语气。**

| 助动词 | 不定式 |
| ---- | ---- |
| must | have to |
| may | be likely to |
| will | be going to |
| can | be able to |
| should | ought to |

```
💡 
They plan to marry next month.
(They plan that they will(are going to)next month)
to do 是定语从句+助动词的简化和转换。

I hate to say that but i think
(I hate that i will(am going to)say ..)

I do not like to wait too long
(I do not like that i have to(must) wait too long.)

I always try to be on time.
(I always try that i can (am able to) on time.)

```

🎯  强制性语气不需要不定式结构。

```
The teacher made the girl leave behind after class.
The teacher asked the girl to leave behind after class.
```

**📘动名词 暗示一种持续性。He is not afraid of death, but i am scared of dying.**

```
Picking apples can be fun.
(That anybodies picks apple can be funs.)
The Picking of apples requires patience.
Apple picking is a strenuous job.

I really enjoyed teaching English to school children.
(I really enjoyed that i tought English to school children.)
```

🎯 使用动名词表示所有格

```
I dislike that john calls my girl friend day after day
I dislike john'calling my girl friend.
```

🎯 动名词和现在分词。

```
That flying bird is a spicial specises.📘状语从句 有因果关系，主句与从句均完整。
flying 为现在分词表示。 The bird is flying.

That flying jacket looks smart on you.
```

因为现在分词是形容词结构动名词是名词结构. 可以将动名词放在介词后面，但是形容词结构不行。

The jacket for flying.

🎯不定式与动名词

```
I love watching horror movies here.
you must not forget to pay the phone bills.
I really enjoyed being at your party.
```

he did not show up on time
something is strange.
That he did not show up on time is strange.
It is strange that he did not show up on time.

## 复句

📘从句分类 

1. 名词性从句
2. 定语从句
3. 状语从句

**📘名词性从句-替代名词，不需要宾语。** 

**引导词： that、weather**

that +S.替代宾语

```
I know something.
I am right.
I know that i am right.
```

🎯<span style="color:blue">主句位置</span>

```
he did not show up on time
something is strange.
That he did not show up on time is strange.
It is strange that he did not show up on time.
```

🎯<span style="color:blue">同位语</span>多名词。

```
The story (that he once killed a man just) be true.

I am afraid of that thing
I am afraid that i cannot help you.
```

🎯<span style="color:blue">whether 引导的名词性从句</span>

```
I can not tell whether he's telling the truth or not.
whether the stock market will improve or not is impossible to say now.
```



🎯

**📘定语从句- 主句和从句有关系，用来修饰、限定、说明前面的名词，从句不需要主语。**

**两个句子之间有重复元素**

```
My father is a man.
He always keeps his words.
My father is man who always keeps his words.

```

| 关系代词 |      | 关系副词 |
| -------- | ---- | -------- |
| who      |      | when     |
| which    |      | where    |
| whose    |      | how      |
| whom     |      | why      |

🎯这里并没有that。有时who、which、可以用that替代，当有明确指示大范围时。

```
man is an animal.
man is capable of reason.
此时可以使用 man is an animal that is capable of reason.
meteorology is a science that deals with the behavior.

已经限定在很小范围内，不需使用that，使用逗点。
I am considering john for my boyfriend who is tall.
I like this book,which may people like too.
```

The rain coomes at time , when farmers needed it most.
